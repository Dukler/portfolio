            My name is Mart√≠n Ochoa. I'm a fullstack developer living in Buenos Aires, Argentina.<br/>
            I started learning software development at high school, and after that it was mostly self taught, and with this mindset I've done multiple projects using various technologies and frameworks.<br/>
            My career started as desktop application developer for ERP software, but my focus quickly shifted to web development. 
            Since then I worked my way up from Junior developer to a Software architect position, and also did many freelance opportunities.<br/>
            Besides coding my hobbies are playing videogames and watching series, movies and videos.
